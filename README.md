# ansible-workstation-playbook

Ansible playbook that will configure new workstation from the scratch.

## Supported OS 

Currently it's only supports Arch-based Linux operating systems that are using Pamac as package manager.

## TODO

Please beare in mind that this is in progress and things can change.

### Tags
Tags need to be re-think to allow differenciate type of the intallations like CLI only or/and GUI.
Each of the programs should have dedicated tag that will allow to install/update and configure only this one program.

### Cloud
Think how we can handle EC2 instances wher I would like to have the same environment.
This can be used by user_data script, AMI itself, SSM... there is plenty of powwibilities.

### Testing
Prepeare Dockerfile that will build container for tests.
